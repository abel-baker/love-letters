/* Game flow:
- Game is created by /newgame, status set to setup; ->
- an Invite is created and assigned by /newgame, status set to invitation; 
- Game begins by beginGame interaction, status set to starting; ->
- possible ready check of some kind for the players;
- a round is dealt to Players and turnIndex is set for one of them;
- round start message is sent ("Let's go, it's sweet william's turn to draw a card"),
  buttons are presented for drawCard (and others), status is drawing;
- after drawing, buttons are presented to the player for playCard/cardtype, series of
  "prompts" via button layouts for playing each card, status is playing;
- card play executes, changing cards, changing hands, eliminating players,
  etc., status is resolving (or similar);
- end condition is checked such as empty deck, only one player remaining:
  proceed if condition is met, otherwise increment turn index and move
  to next player's draw phase;
- after end condition, stop play and send summary/win message;
